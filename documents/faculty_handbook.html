<h2>The Constitution of the Faculty Organization of Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
<p><a id="article1" name="article1"></a><strong>Article I: Name</strong><br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The name of this organization is the Faculty Organization of Carnegie Mellon University. The term Faculty Organization may also be used.</p>
<p><a id="article2" name="article2"></a><strong>Article II: Purpose and Responsibility</strong><br/> <em>Section 1.</em> In accordance with normal practice at major institutions of higher education in the United States, the professionals constituting the faculty bear a primary responsibility for all matters of educational and research policy and of academic freedom. As a means of discharging this responsibility, a chief purpose of the Faculty Organization is to examine these matters and formulate recommendations to the president and other appropriate persons. With a view to the institution's continued success and improvement, the Faculty Organization also has the prerogative of considering any other topic relevant to the interests of the university as well as any topic affecting the welfare of the university community, and to make recommendations thereon. The Faculty Organization also conducts those academic affairs that are delegated to it by the president or by the Board of Trustees.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 2.</em> The representative assembly of the Faculty Organization is the Faculty Senate. The Faculty Senate is empowered to conduct all the affairs of the Faculty Organization except for those otherwise specified in this Constitution and its Bylaws.</p>
<p><a id="article3" name="article3"></a><strong>Article III: Membership in the Faculty Organization</strong><br/> <em>Section 1.</em> All persons holding full-time faculty appointments at Carnegie Mellon University with the rank of professor, associate professor, or assistant professor, or with the equivalent ranks in the teaching faculty or in the research faculty, or as professional librarians or archivists are members of the Faculty Organization. Those holding full-time appointments at the rank of instructor or in the special faculty are also members of the Faculty Organization, provided they have held such appointments for one full academic year.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 2.</em> The membership of the Faculty Organization includes the president and all other administrative officers of the university holding the rank of associate dean or higher (as determined by the president).<br/> <br/> <em>Section 3.</em> Other categories of appointment at the university may be included in the membership of the Faculty Organization as specified in the Bylaws to this Constitution.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 4.</em> Membership may also be conferred upon other academically qualified individuals associated with the university if elected by the Faculty Senate by a majority vote. Nominations are to be made in writing and must be sponsored by five members of the Senate.</p>
<p><a id="article4" name="article4"></a><strong>Article IV: Officers of the Faculty Organization</strong><br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The officers of the Faculty Organization, selected from among its members, are the chair, the vice chair, the chair emeritus, the secretary and the treasurer.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 2.</em> The chair of the Faculty Organization presides at meetings of the Faculty Organization, the Faculty Senate and the Executive Committee and generally represents the Faculty Organization. In the absence of the chair, or at the chair's direction, the vice chair acts as chair. The Secretary of the Faculty Organization supervises all elections and votes of the Faculty Organization. The treasurer of the Faculty Organization oversees the finances under the control of the Faculty Senate and reports on them annually.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 3.</em> The terms of office of the chair, vice chair and chair emeritus are one year each.&#160;<span style="font-size: 1em;">With approval of the senate, the term of the office of the chair, vice chair and chair emeritus can be extended once by one year.&#160;</span>The terms of office of the secretary and treasurer are two years each, commencing in alternate years. The Bylaws determine the dates upon which these terms begin and end.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 4.</em> At the expiration of each year's term, the vice chair becomes the chair for the following term, with these exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who has succeeded or been elected to the office of chair by reason of a vacancy occurring during the latter half (as defined in the Bylaws) of the expiring term remains chair for the following term.</li>
<li>If, at the expiration of the term, the office of vice chair is vacant and there is no continuing chair as described in (a), a chair for the following term is elected.</li>
<li>If, as described in section 3 of this article, the executive committee recommends and the senate approves, the chair&#8217;s term to be extended by one year.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, at any time during a term, the office of chair becomes vacant the vice chair becomes chair for the remainder of the term. If the office of vice chair is vacant at the same time, a chair is elected for the remainder of the term.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 5.</em> At the beginning of each year's term, that member of the Faculty Organization becomes chair&#160;emeritus&#160;who has most recently held the office of chair for a complete term or for at least one-half of a complete term (as defined in the Bylaws), provided that such a person is willing and able to serve, and has not been elected to another office during the new term. The Bylaws specify how the office of chair emeritus is filled if there is no person meeting these qualifications, or if a vacancy in the office occurs before the completion of a term.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 6.</em> Elections to full terms of the vice chair, the secretary and the treasurer, as well as the chair if required under Section 4, above, are decided by the plurality of votes received from the membership of the Faculty Organization, voting as a single constituency. The Bylaws specify how these offices are filled for the remainder of an unexpired term, in case of vacancies.</p>
<p><a id="article5" name="article5"></a><strong>Article V: Membership in the Faculty Senate</strong><br/> <br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The membership of the Faculty Senate consists of elected members, members ex officiis, and appointed members. The number of members in each of these categories and the length of their terms are specified in the Bylaws.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 2.</em> The elected members of the Faculty Senate are the senators and the officers of the Faculty Organization listed in Article IV, Section 1. Senators represent the members of the Faculty Organization in each of the departments in the university (or the schools or other units analogous to departments) and are elected by those units as indicated in the Bylaws.<br/> <br/><em>Section 3.</em>&#160;The members ex officiis are administrative officers of the university with faculty appointments, and those members of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee who are not otherwise members of the Faculty Senate. The president and all provosts, and university deans are members ex officiis of the Faculty Senate. The president may designate other administrative officers who hold the rank of dean or higher to be members ex officiis, but their number may not exceed the limit set in the Bylaws. One chair of each College Faculty, who is elected or appointed by procedures established by the college, is also a member ex officio of the Faculty Senate.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 4.</em> Appointed members of the Faculty Senate are members of the Faculty Organization selected by the president, and members of the university's staff, student body and alumni association as their representatives as indicated in the Bylaws.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 5.</em> Each member of the Faculty Senate is entitled to propose resolutions and to vote on the business of the Senate. Each member has one vote, even if qualified to be a member in more than one capacity.</p>
<p><a id="article6" name="article6"></a><strong>Article VI: Activities of the Faculty Senate</strong><br/> <br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The business of the Faculty Organization is conducted by the Faculty Senate, except that:<br/> <br/> Meetings of the entire Faculty Organization may be called and may conduct business as specified in the Bylaws to this Constitution, including the power to initiate a referendum of the Faculty Organization by letter ballot.<br/> <br/> The Faculty Senate is bound by decisions approved by a majority of the votes received in a referendum of the Faculty Organization.<br/> <em><br/> Section 2.</em> The Faculty Senate may appoint and charge committees, initiate a referendum of the Faculty Organization, call meetings of the Faculty Organization, make recommendations to the administration or other bodies of the university, and decide on actions required to conduct the business of the Faculty Organization.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 3.</em> The Faculty Senate meets on a regular schedule, specified in the Bylaws, during the academic year. Special meetings may also be called. Meetings are normally open to all, although only members of the Faculty Senate may propose resolutions or vote. A quorum of fifteen elected members is required in order to vote on resolutions.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 4.</em> The Faculty Senate must report its actions to the membership of the Faculty Organization in writing and without unusual delay.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 5.</em> Matters whose general dissemination is not in the best interests of the university or the Faculty Organization may be held confidential within the senate or its committees. In order to maintain confidentiality at a meeting, the attendance of non-members may be restricted. Decisions to invoke confidentiality may be made by the presiding officer, but may be overturned by a vote of two-thirds of the members present.</p>
<p><a id="article7" name="article7"></a><strong>Article VII: Committees of the Faculty Senate</strong><br/> <br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The committees of the Faculty Senate include: the Executive Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Faculty Affairs Council, and the Budget and Financial Affairs Committee. Other standing committees may be established in the Bylaws. Ad hoc committees may be established by resolution of the Senate or by action of the chair of the Faculty Organization. Each committee is directly responsible and responsive to the Faculty Senate, and reports its actions and recommendations to the Senate. Appointments to these committees are made by the procedures established in the Bylaws.<br/> <em><br/></em></p>

Each is named and charged, and its size and composition is specified, in the Bylaws.<br/> <br/> <em>Section 7.</em> Ad hoc committees, established by resolution or by action of the chair of the Faculty Organization, are those conceived as having temporary, finite or exploratory functions. These are charged in writing by the chair of the Faculty Organization. Such a charge includes the purpose, composition, size and terms of appointments to the committee as well as an indication of the date or completed task that determines the dissolution of the committee. A resolution of the Faculty Senate may disband or alter the charge for each committee in this category.</p>
<p><a id="article8" name="article8"></a><strong>Article VIII: Faculty Senate Appointments to University Councils and Committees</strong><br/> <br/> <em>Section 1.</em> By agreement with the university administration, the Faculty Senate appoints representatives to university councils and committees. They are full members of the council or committee to which they have been appointed and are responsible to maintain communications between that body and the senate.

The Bylaws also specify the manner in which vacancies in unexpired terms are filled, and may entrust that responsibility to the Executive Committee.</p>
<p><a id="article10" name="article10"></a><strong>Article X: Bylaws</strong><br/> <br/> <em>Section 1.</em> The Faculty Senate establishes Bylaws to this Constitution which govern matters required by, or not otherwise specified in, this Constitution.
